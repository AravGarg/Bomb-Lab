Note: Use Bomb5.idb as the reference and Bomb6.idb as the solution for this phase.

Checking the next unknown function, we first color and group the nodes to simplify the loops and nested loops.

Analysis of outer for loop 1:
The outer counter iterates through the input array of 6 numbers and calls bomb_explode if the numbers lie outside the range [1,6].

Analysis of for loop 1:
The outer and inner counter check each of the 15 combinations of the 6 numbers and calls bomb_explode if any pair of numbers are equal.

Hence, from this we see that we need to input 6 distinct numbers in the range [1,6].

Analysis of outer loop 2:
This loop checks the input number and pushes the corresponding node of the linked list.

Analysis of inner for loop 2:
This loop iterates through the linked list till we reach the node which corresponds to the input number.

Analysis of for loop 3:
This loop rearranges the linked list according to the input indices.

Analysis of for loop 4:
This loop calls bomb_explode if the numbers in the rearranged linked list is not in descending order.

Hence, we see that we need to pass as input the indices [1,6] such that their corresponding numbers are in decreasing order.

Given list:
1-253
2-725
3-301
4-997
5-212
6-432

Hence,our required password is ``` 4 2 6 3 1 5 ```.

This completes the project.
