The next unknown function is sub_401210. Digging into this function, we see that it takes 3 inputs from the user, first an 
integer between 0 and 7, next a character and third another integer. The correct password depends on the first integer passed in,as shown in the jumptable.

This gives us 8 cases:
0q777
1b214
2b755
3k251
4o160
5t458
6v780
7b524

Any of these will work as the password for Phase3.
