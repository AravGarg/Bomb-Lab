# Bomb-Lab
The Bomb Lab provides 6 Reverse Engineering exercises. At each stage,we are prompted for a password; entering the correct password proceeds us to the next exercise. An incorrect answer will cause the bomb to blow and send us back to the beginning.

I have used IDA 7.0 (Free Version) to disassemble the Bomb.ex_ binary.
