Note: Use Bomb3.idb as a reference and Bomb4.idb as the solution for this phase.

Going into the next unknown function after phase3, we see an unknown function sub_401350. Inspecting this function, we see that
this is a recursive algorithm with the base cases:
algo(0)=1.
algo(1)=1.

The recursive algorithm used is:
algo(i)=algo(i-1)+algo(i-2)

This is clearly the Fibonacci series. Hence this function can be renamed as Fibonacci_Index, as it returns the term of the 
Fibonacci sequence corresponding to the given index.

Using this, we see that the password for this phase is that index which returns 55 when passed onto the Fibonacci_index function.
Hence, we get the password for this phase as ```9```.
